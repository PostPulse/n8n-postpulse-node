## Prerequisites

1. **Sign up** at https://post-pulse.com/login  
2. **Connect your social accounts** in the web app: https://post-pulse.com/app/accounts  
3. **Request API credentials**: email **support@post-pulse.com** to obtain `client_id` and `client_secret` and share with us redirect URL generated by n8n
4. (Telegram only) Add the official **PostPulse bot** to your channels you plan to post to.

> Use the same email in n8n OAuth as your PostPulse account email.

---

## Install

- **From npm (recommended):**
  ```bash
  npm install @postpulse/n8n-nodes-postpulse
  ```
- Restart n8n and enable the node in **Settings → Community Nodes** if required.

---

## Authenticate

Create **Credentials → PostPulse OAuth2 API** in n8n:

- **OAuth Redirect URL:** share this value in email to **support@post-pulse.com**
- **Client ID / Secret:** obtained from support  

This node extends n8n’s `oAuth2Api` so **tokens are refreshed automatically**.  

---

## Quick start

1. **Accounts → Get Many**  
   Retrieve your connected accounts. Save the `id` of targets you’ll post to.
2. **Telegram → Get Connected Chats** *(only if posting to Telegram)*  
   Input: `id` from step 1 (platform must be `TELEGRAM`). Output contains `id` per channel/chat.
3. **Media → Upload** *(for any media)*  
   Upload files (even if you have public URLs). Some platforms (e.g., TikTok/Instagram) require media hosted on post-pulse.com. Save the returned `path`.
4. **Posts → Schedule**  
   Build one `PostSchedule` with one or more `Publication`s.  
   - Set `scheduledTime` (past/now = queue immediately)
   - For now, prefer `isDraft: false` (update APIs will come later).

---

## Operations

### Accounts: **Get Many**
- **Output:** Array of accounts: `{ id, platform, handle, ... }`
- **Use:** Pick `id` for each destination.

### Telegram: **Get Connected Chats**
- **Input:** `{ id }` (must be a Telegram account)
- **Output:** Array: `{ id, title }` — pass `chatId` into Telegram posts.

### Media: **Upload**
- **Input:** File
- **Output:** `{ path }` — use in `attachmentPaths` of posts.

### Posts: **Schedule**
- **Input:** `PostSchedule` (see [Data model](#data-model))
- **Behavior:** Schedules one or multiple publications for the same time.
- **Recommended:** `isDraft: false` (until update endpoints are exposed in node).

---

## Data model

### `PostSchedule`
```json
{
  "scheduledTime": "2025-08-17T14:03:00",
  "isDraft": false,
  "publications": [ /* Publication[] */ ]
}
```

### `Publication`
Represents “one publication in user’s mind” that may map to *one or many* platform posts.

```json
{
  "socialMediaAccountId": 442,
  "posts": [ /* Post[] */ ],
  "platformSettings": { /* see below */ }
}
```

- **One publication → multiple posts** is useful when:
  - Telegram account posts to several **channels** (one post per channel)
  - Telegram account posts with large text or more than 10 media (one post per message that will be published)
  - Instagram **storyline** (multiple stories in one conceptual set)

### `Post`
```json
{
  "attachmentPaths": [
    "6354d8d2-e0f1-702b-af6c-62e28e377ec7/c6c2b826-8aca-4eae-8549-515325012ab4.jpeg"
  ],
  "content": "Your caption or description",
  "chatId": "1234567890"   // Telegram only
  /* "thumbnailPath": "..." — coming soon */
}
```

> **Note:** For YouTube/TikTok, `content` is used as **description** (titles are set in `platformSettings`).

---

## Platform settings

Each **Publication** must include `platformSettings` with a required discriminator: `type`.

```json
{ "type": "INSTAGRAM", "publicationType": "REELS" }
```

Supported shapes:

### Instagram
```json
{
  "type": "INSTAGRAM",
  "publicationType": "FEED" | "REELS" | "STORY"

## Rate limits & API keys

- Authentication uses **OAuth2**; tokens are auto-refreshed by n8n.
- PostPulse runs on AWS API Gateway usage plans. Typical plans:
  - **Standard:** 20 RPS burst, 200 RPS steady, 50k req/month
  - **Agency:** higher limits on request

## FAQ

**Do I have to upload media to PostPulse even if I have a public URL?**  
Yes. Platforms like TikTok/Instagram can validate source URLs; we require hosting under `post-pulse.com`.

**Can I draft then update later via the node?**  
In v1 of the node, we recommend `isDraft: false`. Update endpoints will be exposed in a later version.

**How do I post to multiple accounts at once?**  
Create one `PostSchedule` with multiple `Publication` objects (one per account).

**How do I set YouTube or TikTok titles?**  
Titles live in **`platformSettings`** (see schemas above). `content` becomes description.
